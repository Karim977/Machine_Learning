Machine learning problem in which a nearest-neighbor classifier is built to solve this problem. Given information about a user — how many pages they’ve visited, whether they’re shopping on a weekend, what web browser they’re using, etc. — the classifier will predict whether or not the user will make a purchase. To train your classifier, data is provided from a shopping website from about 12,000 users sessions.
